# a11y audit

An automated website accessibility crawler that analyzes web pages for WCAG compliance issues using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and Playwright.

## What It Does

This tool crawls a website and generates a comprehensive accessibility report identifying violations, grouped by severity level (critical, serious, moderate, minor). It automatically:

- Crawls multiple pages on a website (configurable limit)
- Runs axe-core accessibility tests on each page
- Identifies WCAG violations with detailed descriptions
- Generates a Markdown report with affected elements and remediation guidance
- Finds on average 57% of WCAG issues automatically

## Installation

bun install
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
